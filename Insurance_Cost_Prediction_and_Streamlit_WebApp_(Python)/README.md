## Medical Insurance Cost Prediction using ML regression model
- Build a machine learning model using traditional machine learning regression methods such as random forest and Gradient Boosting to accurately predict the medical insurance cost.
- Then, build an interactive web-based dashboard using Streamlit to be able to utilize the model to give prdiction output by inserting custom user input.

### Dataset
- age
- sex: male or female
- bmi: Body Mass Index (BMI) is an objective measure of body weight relative to height, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared (kg/mÂ²). A healthy BMI range is typically between 18.5 and 24.9, indicating a balanced weight for height.
- children: Number of children/dependents
- smoker: smoking / non-smoking
- region: the beneficiary's residential area in the US- northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest.
